# BlackJack_Game-
This project is a milestone project for my Python course from Udemy.
It is a BlackJack game - a pretty basic one. Obviously help was taken from chatGpt and also from the WalkThrough soultion provided by the course guide. 
I actually had no idea how BlackJack works, to make it simpler for the help from chatGpt was taken to help me understand how this certain function works in the game which I am creating. The help was also taken to debug certain problems which were being faced by me in the code.

Overall, it was a fun learning experience. I did not only code a game just for the sake of doing it, but understood how the game is played with the help of AI - all while writing the code of the game simultaneously.
